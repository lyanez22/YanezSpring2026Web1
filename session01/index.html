    <p>I am an aspiring UX engineer, interested in designing healthcare software, video game interfaces, and graphic design. As a third-year student at Hunter College, double majoring in Human-Computing Interaction and Computer Science, I am learning how to combine design and conducting research in user experience to create prototypes to test and analyze trends that could benefit healthcare applications. I use programs like Figma and Framer, along with coding environments such as Visual Studio code to bring my ideas to life. I enjoy exploring creative design, such as experimenting with pixel art in video games or websites and 3D modeling.
