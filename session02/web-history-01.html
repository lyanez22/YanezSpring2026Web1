        <h3>EARLY 20C, Mundaneum, Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine</h3>
        <p>The Mundaneum was an institution founded in 1910 by Belgian lawyers and bibliographers Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine. It aimed to collect and organize all human knowledge through a vast repository of documents, books, and other materials. The Mundaneum utilized a system of index cards and a classification system known as the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) to categorize information. Otlet envisioned the Mundaneum as a precursor to the modern internet, where people could access information from anywhere in the world. Although the Mundaneum faced challenges and eventually declined, its vision of a global information network laid the groundwork for future developments in information science and technology.</p>
