        <h2>History of the Web</h2>
        <h3>Early 20C, Mundaneum, Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine</h3>
        <p>The Mundaneum was an institution which aimed to gather together all the world's knowledge and classify it according to a system called the Universal Decimal Classification. It was developed at the turn of the 20th century by Belgian lawyers Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine. The Mundaneum has been identified as a milestone in the history of data collection and management, and (somewhat more tenuously) as a precursor to the Internet.</p>

        <h3>1945, Memex, Vannevar Bush</h3>
        <p>A memex (a portmanteau of "memory" and "index") is a hypothetical electromechanical device for interacting with microform documents and described in Vannevar Bush's 1945 article "As We May Think". Bush envisioned the memex as a device in which individuals would compress and store all of their books, records, and communications, "mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility". The individual was supposed to use the memex as an automatic personal filing system, making the memex "an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory".</p>

        <h3>1960s, Project Xanadu “hypertext”, Ted Nelson</h3>
        <p>Project Xanadu (/ˈzænəduː/ ZAN-ə-doo) was the first hypertext project, founded in 1960 by Ted Nelson. Administrators of Project Xanadu declared it superior to the World Wide Web, with the mission statement: "Today's popular software simulates paper. The World Wide Web (another imitation of paper) trivialises our original hypertext model with one-way ever-breaking links and no management of version or contents."</p>

        <h3>1960s, The birth of the Internet, ARPANET</h3>
        <p>The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was the first wide-area packet-switched network with distributed control and one of the first computer networks to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite. Both technologies became the technical foundation of the Internet. The ARPANET was established by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (now DARPA) of the United States Department of Defense.</p>

        <h3>First email, Ray Tomlinson, 1971</h3>
        <p>Raymond Samuel Tomlinson (April 23, 1941 – March 5, 2016) was an American computer programmer who invented the first email program on the ARPANET system, the precursor to the Internet, in 1971; it was the first system able to send mail between users on different hosts connected to ARPANET. Previously, mail could be sent only to others who used the same computer. To achieve this, he used the @ sign to separate the username from the name of their machine, a scheme which has been used in email addresses ever since.</p>

        <h3>Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP), Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn, 1983</h3>
        <p>The Internet protocol suite, commonly known as TCP/IP, is a framework for organizing the communication protocols used in the Internet and similar computer networks according to functional criteria. The foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and the Internet Protocol (IP). Early versions of this networking model were known as the Department of Defense (DoD) Internet Architecture Model because the research and development were funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the United States Department of Defense.</p>

        <h3>Invention of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau at CERN, 1989</h3>
        <p>The World Wide Web (also known as WWW, W3, or simply the Web)[2] is a public interconnected information system that enables content sharing over the Internet.[3] It facilitates access to documents and other web resources according to specific rules of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).[4]</p>

        <h3>Foundations of a website URL /HTTP/HTML/BROWSER, Tim Berners-Lee, 1990</h3>
        <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

        <h3>First website, Tim Berners-Lee, 1991</h3>
        <p>Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee (born 8 June 1955),[1] also known as TimBL, is an English computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, HTML, the URL system, and HTTP. He is a professorial research fellow at the University of Oxford[2] and a professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[3][4]</p>

        <h3>The first search engine, Alan Emtage, Archie index, 1990</h3>
        <p>Archie is a tool for indexing FTP archives, allowing users to more easily identify specific files. It is considered the first Internet search engine.[2] The original implementation was written in 1990 by Alan Emtage, then a postgraduate student at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.[3][4][5][6] Archie was superseded by other, more sophisticated search engines, including Jughead and Veronica, which were search engines for the Gopher protocol. These were in turn superseded by World Wide Web search engines like AltaVista and directories like Yahoo! in 1995. Work on Archie ceased in the late 1990s...</p>

        <h3>The first photo on the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, 1992</h3>
        <p>Les Horribles Cernettes (French pronunciation: [le.z‿ɔʁiblə sɛʁnɛt], "The Horrible CERN Girls") was an all-female parody pop group, self-labelled "the one and only High Energy Rock Band", which was founded by employees of CERN and performed at CERN and other HEP-related events. Their main claim to fame is that a photograph of them was the earliest photographic image shared on the World Wide Web.[1]</p>

        <h3>The invention of Wi-Fi, IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi standard, 1997</h3>
        <p>Wi-Fi (/ˈwaɪfaɪ/)[1][a] is a family of wireless network protocols based on the IEEE 802.11 family of standards, which are commonly used for local area networking of devices and Internet access, allowing nearby digital devices to exchange data by radio waves. These are the most widely used computer networks, used globally in home and small office networks to link devices and to provide Internet access with wireless routers and wireless access points in public places such as coffee shops, restaurants, hotels, libraries, and airports.</p>
