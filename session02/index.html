    <p>I am an aspiring UX engineer, interested in designing healthcare software, video game interfaces, and graphic design. As a third-year student at Hunter College, double majoring in Human-Computing Interaction and Computer Science, I am learning how to combine design and conducting research in user experience to create prototypes to test and analyze trends that could benefit healthcare applications. I use programs like Figma and Framer, along with coding environments such as Visual Studio code to bring my ideas to life. I enjoy exploring creative design, such as experimenting with pixel art in video games or websites and 3D modeling.

    <h2>History of the Web</h2>
    <p>The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. The web was created to facilitate the sharing of information among scientists and researchers across the globe. Berners-Lee developed the first web browser and web server, laying the foundation for the modern internet. The web quickly gained popularity, leading to the development of websites, online services, and e-commerce platforms that have transformed how we communicate, access information, and conduct business.</p>
