        <h2>History of the Web</h2>

        <h3>EARLY 20C, Mundaneum, Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine</h3>
        <p>The Mundaneum was an institution founded in 1910 by Belgian lawyers and bibliographers Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine. It aimed to collect and organize all human knowledge through a vast repository of documents, books, and other materials. The Mundaneum utilized a system of index cards and a classification system known as the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) to categorize information. Otlet envisioned the Mundaneum as a precursor to the modern internet, where people could access information from anywhere in the world. Although the Mundaneum faced challenges and eventually declined, its vision of a global information network laid the groundwork for future developments in information science and technology.</p>

        <h3>1945, Memex, Vannevar Bush</h3>
        <p>A memex (a portmanteau of "memory" and "index") is a hypothetical electromechanical device for interacting with microform documents and described in Vannevar Bush's 1945 article "As We May Think". Bush envisioned the memex as a device in which individuals would compress and store all of their books, records, and communications, "mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility". The individual was supposed to use the memex as an automatic personal filing system, making the memex "an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory".[1]</p>
        <h3>1960s, Project Xanadu “hypertext”, ted nelson</h3>
        <p>Project Xanadu (/ˈzænəduː/ ZAN-ə-doo)[1] was the first hypertext project, founded in 1960 by Ted Nelson. Administrators of Project Xanadu declared it superior to the World Wide Web, with the mission statement: "Today's popular software simulates paper. The World Wide Web (another imitation of paper) trivialises our original hypertext model with one-way ever-breaking links and no management of version or contents."[2]</p>

        <h3>1960s The birth of the Internet ARPANET</h3>
        <p>The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was the first wide-area packet-switched network with distributed control and one of the first computer networks to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite. Both technologies became the technical foundation of the Internet. The ARPANET was established by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (now DARPA) of the United States Department of Defense.[1]</p>

        <h3>first email Ray Tomlinson 1971</h3>
        <p>Ray Tomlinson sent the first email in 1971 using the ARPANET. The email was sent from one computer to another on the network, and it was a simple message that read "test". This event marked the beginning of email communication on the internet.</p>

        <h3>1983, TCP/IP, Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn</h3>
<p>
In 1983, the Internet adopted the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) as its
standard networking protocol. Developed by Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn, TCP/IP allowed different
computer networks to communicate with each other as one unified global network. This transition
is often considered the official birth of the modern Internet because it made large-scale,
reliable communication between networks possible. The protocol suite provided the foundation
for how data is transmitted across the internet today.

<h3>1989, Invention of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau</h3>
<p>
In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, working at CERN, proposed a system to share documents using hypertext
over the Internet. With help from Robert Cailliau, this idea became the World Wide Web. The goal
was to help scientists easily share research across different computers and locations. This
invention introduced the idea of linking documents together through clickable links, creating
the foundation for modern websites and online information sharing.

<h3>1990, URL / HTTP / HTML / Browser Foundations, Tim Berners-Lee</h3>
<p>
In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee created the essential technologies that make websites work today.
He developed HTML (the language used to create web pages), HTTP (the protocol used to transfer
web pages), and URLs (the addressing system for websites). He also built the first web browser
and web server. Together, these technologies formed the core structure that still powers the web.

<h3>1991, First Website, Tim Berners-Lee</h3>
<p>
The first website went live in 1991 at CERN. It explained how the World Wide Web worked and
how others could create their own websites and servers. This moment marked the public launch
of the web and allowed people outside of research institutions to begin exploring and building
online content.

<h3>1990, First Search Engine “Archie”, Alan Emtage</h3>
<p>
Alan Emtage created Archie in 1990, the first search engine for the Internet. Archie indexed
files stored on FTP servers so users could search for downloadable resources more easily.
Although it was simple compared to modern search engines like Google, Archie introduced the
idea of searching the Internet for information.

<h3>1992, First Photo on the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee</h3>
<p>
The first photo ever uploaded to the Internet appeared in 1992. It was a picture of a parody
band from CERN called “Les Horribles Cernettes.” This event showed that the web could be used
for multimedia, not just text, helping pave the way for images, videos, and social media.

<h3>1997, Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11 Standard)</h3>
<p>
In 1997, the IEEE released the 802.11 wireless networking standard, which later became known
as Wi-Fi. This technology allowed devices to connect to the Internet wirelessly instead of
using cables. Wi-Fi made the Internet more accessible and mobile, leading to the widespread
use of laptops, smartphones, and smart devices.
