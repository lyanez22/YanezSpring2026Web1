    <h2>Characteristics of early web art</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Interactivity and Participation
            <ul>
                <li>Early internet art required the viewer to become a participant, often transforming passive browsing
                    into active engagement. Works were rarely static; they were designed to be clicked, manipulated, or
                    altered by the user, making the audience a part of the creative process.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Immateriality and Virtual Existence</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Unlike traditional art, early internet art often existed only in the digital realm, defying physicality
                and traditional gallery structures. It lived as code on servers, HTML, and browser windows, emphasizing
                a "non-object" or ephemeral quality.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Networkability and Connectivity</li>
        <ul>
            <li> The art was often distributed and social, relying on email lists, web browsers, and hyperlinks to
                create a "networked" experience. This enabled global reach and fostered collaboration, as seen in
                projects shared across distributed, international communities.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Use of "Web 1.0" Aesthetics and Code</li>
        <ul>
            <li> Artists often used the raw tools of the early internet—basic HTML code, browser frames, glitch
                aesthetics, and early graphic user interfaces—as their medium. Examples include the chaotic,
                anti-aesthetic, and deconstructive work of collective JODI, which treated code and error messages as
                art.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Subversion of Institutions and Commercialism</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Early internet art often held a "utopian," democratic ethos, aiming to bypass traditional art galleries,
                museums, and market structures. It was often created by enthusiasts and artists operating outside
                conventional commercial art systems.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
